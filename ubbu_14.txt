<h1>cricket</h1>
<p1>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven 
players on a field at the centre of which is a 20-metre (22-yard) pitch
 with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps.
 The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with 
the bat, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss
 each player (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when 
the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side catching 
the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground. When ten players 
have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated
 by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. 
They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.</p1>
<h1>batminton</h1>
<p1>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net.
 Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" 
(with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played
 as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular 
indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within
 the opposing side's half of the court.</p1>
<h1>volley ball</h1>
<p1>Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team 
tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.[1] It 
has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964.

The complete set of rules are extensive,[2] but play essentially proceeds as follows: a player
 on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting
 it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into 
the receiving team's court.[3] The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their
 court. The team may touch the ball up to 3 times, but individual players may not touch the ball
 twice consecutively.[3] Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack, an 
attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to 
prevent it from being grounded in their court.</p1>
<h1>indoor games</h1>
<p1>Indoor sports complexes are springing up around the country (ex: South Shore Sports Complex 
in Oceanside, NY). These complexes often provide a Turf Field that allows a wide variety of 
typically outdoor sports to be played indoors. These turf fields are large and has a grassy texture 
to it without the maintenance required to keep it green and plush. Many sports are being played on
 this type of service, such as soccer, baseball, flag football, shooting softball, lacrosse, rugby,
 and many others.[2] </p1>
